use all these files and create a requirements.txt file

Based on your Python backend code (app.py), I'll create a requirements.txt file with the necessary dependencies for your authentication system.


Requirements.txt
Code 
This requirements.txt file includes:

Flask: The web framework your application is built on
Flask-CORS: For handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) which you're using to allow frontend-backend communication
Flask-Bcrypt: For password hashing functionality
Flask-JWT-Extended: For JSON Web Token authentication which you're using for login sessions
PyMongo: The MongoDB driver for Python to connect to your database
python-dotenv: Added as a best practice for environment variable management (useful for handling your JWT secret key in production)
You can install these dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Note that I've included version numbers to ensure compatibility. Your application uses MongoDB as its database, so make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on the default port (27017) for the application to work properly.







flask==2.3.3
flask-cors==4.0.0
flask-bcrypt==1.0.1
flask-jwt-extended==4.5.2
pymongo==4.5.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
